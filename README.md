- In Mongoose, a virtual is a property that is not stored in MongoDB. Virtuals are typically used for computed properties on documents.
- Virtuals are document properties that you can get and set but that do not get persisted to MongoDB. 

[Serialization Tutorial](https://hazelcast.com/glossary/serialization/)
Serialization is the process of mapping an object to a BSON document that can be saved in MongoDB, and deserialization is the reverse process of reconstructing an object from a BSON document. For that reason the serialization process is also often referred to as “Object Mapping.”

Serialization is the process of converting a data object—a combination of code and data represented within a region of data storage—into a series of bytes that saves the state of the object in an easily transmittable form.

Data serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to more easily save or transmit it.

Serialization enables us to save the state of an object and recreate the object in a new location. Serialization encompasses both the storage of the object and exchange of data.
